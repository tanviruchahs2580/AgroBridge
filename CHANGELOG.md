# Changelog

All notable changes to AgroBridge are documented here.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **AI relevance (P1):** Irrigation questions ("When should I irrigate my rice field?" / "ধানের জমিতে পানি কখন দেব?") were answered with rice-blast disease advice at 85% "grounded" confidence. Root cause: every KB entry of a crop repeats the crop-name keyword, so a bare crop mention scored equally with the actual topic. Retrieval now uses tiered scoring — topical keywords (weighted, phrases higher) always outrank crop-name aliases; caller-provided crop context stays authoritative. Regression test added (`ai-eval.test.ts`).
- **My Farm:** "3 important tasks" headline was hardcoded; it now reflects the real task count (Bengali pluralization preserved).
- **Home:** Greeting rendered a duplicated 👋 (i18n string already contains it).

### Added
- **Dark theme (designed):** New additive `dark.css` token layer — renders only under OS dark scheme; light mode byte-identical. Warm dark-green surface ramp, remapped cards/nav/dot-pattern/shimmer, WCAG-conscious text hierarchy.
- **Booking sheet a11y:** Services booking sheet now exposes `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal` + `aria-label`, moves focus in on open, closes on Escape, and restores focus on close.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **Modal (P0):** Shared `Modal` rendered inside `#main` while `useDialogA11y` marked `#main` `inert` — the dialog blocked itself (Wallet withdraw modal was completely unclickable). `Modal` now renders through a portal to `document.body`; markup and styling unchanged.
- **Checkout (P0):** `enterprise-enter` keyframes retained `transform: scale(1)` via `fill-mode: both`, keeping a permanent stacking context on every animated section — fixed overlays (checkout "Done" button, modals) painted below the fixed `BottomNav`/`TopBar`. Final keyframe is now `transform: none`: identical pixels at rest, no lingering stacking context.
- **Notifications (P1):** "Mark all read" from a filtered tab never refreshed the unread badge (only the ALL-tab load recomputes counters). Counters are now zeroed deterministically on success — server marks everything read.
- **Dark mode (P1):** Removed the `prefers-color-scheme: dark` stone-50/100 swaps that rendered a half-dark hybrid (black page behind white cards) for OS-dark users. The locked design is light-only; a dark theme needs a designed token set first.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **Splash (Android 12+):** Removed the extra OEM-colored pre-launch screen (sage on HyperOS). The platform launch splash reads only `android:windowSplashScreenBackground` / `android:windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon`, which were missing — added `values-v31/styles.xml` with both, pointing at the brand `#0A2F1F` background and a new `splash_icon` vector (white disc + green sprout) that mirrors the in-app Splash. Tap → branded launch animation → login, with no foreign screen in between. Completes the 1.3.0 splash work, which only set the library-prefixed attrs (used on API 24-30 only).
- **Splash (API 24-30):** Added `windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon` to the compat theme so pre-12 devices get the same branded icon.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **Splash:** Eliminated white native launch screen; native splash now uses #0A2F1F to match React Splash (capacitor.config.ts, styles.xml, splash.png assets)
- **Lint:** Fixed conditional hook violation in Splash.tsx (moved hooks before early return) and empty catch in App.tsx
- **Accessibility:** Removed tabIndex=-1 from Login password toggle (keyboard users can now reach it)
- **Accessibility:** Increased ErrorBanner dismiss button to 44px touch target (WCAG AAA)
- **Security:** Added top-level password/token redaction in Pino logger (logger.ts)
- **Security:** Set android:allowBackup=false in AndroidManifest (financial app protection)
- **Security:** Added HSTS and Permissions-Policy headers to NGINX prod config
- **Security:** Added registration rate limiter (10/hr) to prevent mass account creation
- **Data:** Fixed hardcoded weather coords in MyFarm.tsx to use browser geolocation with fallback
- **Types:** Fixed 3 `any` types in ui.tsx touch handlers (React.TouchEvent)
- **Hygiene:** Deleted backup files services.page.backup.tsx and Services.tsx.backup (572 lines dead code)
- **Docs:** Added MIT license field to all package.json files

### Added
- **Config:** Created .editorconfig for consistent formatting
- **Config:** Created values/colors.xml for splash_background #0A2F1F (Android 12+ windowSplashScreenBackground)
- **Docs:** Initial CHANGELOG.md
