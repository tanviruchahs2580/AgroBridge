# Security Waivers

Accepted-risk register for known vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed immediately.
Every waiver needs: reason, compensating control, and an **expiry date** — expired rows
must be re-reviewed or remediated. Reviewed monthly alongside `npm audit` (docs/operations.md).

| CVE/GHSA | Package | Severity | Why accepted | Compensating control | Expiry date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp | vitest | Moderate | Dev-only test dependency — not installed in production images (`npm ci --workspace @agrobridge/api` runtime stage excludes dev deps); fix requires a major version bump scheduled separately | Not exposed to network traffic; CI-only execution; tracked by weekly Dependabot + npm audit in CI | **2026-09-30** |

Rules:

- No waivers for runtime dependencies without staff-engineer + security-engineer sign-off.
- Dev-dependency waivers may be accepted by any engineer but still expire.
- On expiry: bump the package or renew the waiver with fresh justification — silent rollover is not allowed.
